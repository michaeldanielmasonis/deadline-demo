You stand in front of your mirror the next morning, brush dangling loosely in your hand. For a fleeting moment, you imagine what it would’ve been like if you’d gone along with Keira and River’s suggestion—the eyeliner, the black hoodie with the sleeves cut, the heavy boots scuffing against the linoleum floors at school. To walk through the halls looking like a Death Eater, cloaked in sharp edges and don’t-care stares.

Instead, your reflection looks like… you. Jeans, a fitted T-shirt, sneakers that squeak a little when you move. Ordinary, safe. Part of you wonders if you missed an opportunity to blend in somewhere unexpected, to learn more. But another part of you feels relief. Pretending to be someone else—someone harder, darker—doesn’t feel like the way forward.

A knock on the doorframe makes you jump. Your mom leans in, her hair half-pinned, coffee mug in hand. Her eyes soften when she takes you in.

“Wow,” she says with a smile that warms the room, “you look nice this morning. Polished. Put-together.”

“Thanks, Mom,” you say, embarrassed by the way her approval tugs at something inside you.

She takes another sip of coffee and nods toward your backpack. “Ready for the day?”

“As ready as I’ll ever be,” you mutter, zipping it shut.

On the ride to school, the streets hum with the ordinary: buses groaning at their stops, a couple of kids on bikes racing each other, the faint thrum of the radio your mom turns down whenever the news comes on. Outside, the September air is crisp and clean, the kind that makes you want to believe in fresh starts.

Inside, though, your stomach is tight. You may look like everyone else, blending in with your jeans and sneakers, but you know today won’t be normal. Not really.

By the time your mom drops you at the curb, the school bell echoes faintly across the lawn. You sling your backpack over your shoulder and square your jaw. Whatever today holds—Ms. Chase, your unfinished cliques article, the shadow of Kylie’s absence—you’ll have to face it looking like yourself.

And maybe that’s enough.
