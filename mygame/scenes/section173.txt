The clang of Declan’s wrench echoes in the auto shop as you step closer, notebook tucked under your arm. He doesn’t look up, but you force yourself to speak anyway.

“I was hoping to get your perspective,” you begin, your voice steady but quiet. “For my article. I’m writing about cliques at Madison, and I don’t want to leave anyone out. The Delinquents deserve to be heard, too.”

Declan snorts under the hood of the Camaro. “Cliques. Figures.” He wipes his hands on a rag and finally turns to face you, his dark eyes narrowing. “You think we’re just another category to check off in your little yearbook project?”

You shake your head quickly. “No. Not like that. I don’t want stereotypes—I want the truth. I want people to understand who you really are, not just the rumors.”

For a moment, something flickers across his face, but it’s gone just as fast. “You don’t get it,” he says flatly. “Nobody wants the truth. They want headlines. Delinquents cause trouble. Delinquents skip class. Delinquents ruin everything. You writing about us just makes it worse.”

You clutch your notebook tighter. “That’s why I came to you. If you’d just give me a quote, something real, I could show people there’s more to you than that.”

Declan leans back against the car, folding his arms across his patched jacket. His jaw works like he’s grinding his teeth. “And what’s in it for me? For us? Another page where people laugh and say, ‘Figures, that’s the Delinquents’? No thanks.”

“Declan—” you start, but he cuts you off with a sharp wave of his hand.

“Forget it, Lane. Save your breath. You’re not writing us into your neat little boxes.” He pushes past you toward the tool bench, dismissing you without another glance.

Your heart sinks. You’d tried to be honest, to give him the chance to speak for himself. But instead of winning his trust, you’ve only reinforced his walls.

As you turn toward the door, the buzz of your phone in your pocket makes you jump. Toby. The license plate trace.

Maybe Declan wouldn’t talk—but there were still other ways forward.
