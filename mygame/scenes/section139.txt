The veranda is quieter than the dance hall, the muffled beat of the music slipping through the doors behind you. Fairy lights string across the railing, glowing softly against the night sky. You draw in a shaky breath, still warmed by Abbey’s words a moment ago — her reminder that you weren’t truly alone here.

Abbey stands beside you, her arms folded, eyes scanning the gardens below. But when she turns back toward you, her face has gone pale in the gentle light, and she clutches her phone like it’s hot enough to burn.

"Jessi," she whispers, stepping closer. "I didn’t want to tell the guys yet, but I found something earlier today. While I was decorating for the dance."

Your heart skips. "What did you find?"

Abbey glances around, even though the veranda is empty, then leans in. "An unlocked phone. It was shoved behind a box in the storage room off the gym." Her eyes lock onto yours. "Jessi… it was Kylie’s."

The blood drains from your face. "Kylie’s?"

Abbey nods quickly, her voice tight. "The battery was almost dead. I didn’t have time to look through everything, but I found a draft message. She never sent it, but I screenshotted it before the phone shut off."

She turns the screen toward you. The glow cuts through the darkness, and the words stare back at you:

She’s found me. Get help. At the Gardens.

Your stomach twists, the message burning into your mind. "At the Gardens… oh my God."

Abbey bites her lip, her voice dropping. "I don’t know why she didn’t call the police. Maybe she didn’t have time. Or maybe…" She hesitates. "Maybe she didn’t trust them. You’ve seen how Detective Garcia treats anyone who gets too close. Kylie might have been afraid they’d dismiss her. Or worse — tip off the wrong person."

Your pulse hammers in your ears. "Or maybe whoever was after her was right there. Calling would’ve been too loud. Too risky. A draft message would’ve been faster — something she thought she could slip out before—"

You stop, the words tangling in your throat.

Abbey grabs your arm, her grip firm and urgent. "Jessi, if Kylie was really here at the Gardens, with D’Anglia… then we’re running out of time."

From inside, laughter spills through the doors as the music swells again, bright and careless. But standing there under the fairy lights, it feels like it’s coming from another world — one where Kylie Addams never vanished.
