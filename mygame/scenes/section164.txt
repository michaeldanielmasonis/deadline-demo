Branches claw at your jacket. You taste copper at the back of your tongue and force your hands to stop trembling. The sound of her search drifts past you: a flash of a torch, the scrape of a coat through briars. For an hour it feels like forever. Each time Ms. Chase’s light washes close you feel like you’re going to be seen; each time it passes, you let out a silent, half-gasping prayer and press lower into the dark.

Then — lights. Distant at first, then growing: the angry red and blue throb of police cruisers. Sirens wail, a keening high and sharp that tears the night open. Ms. Chase freezes, torchbeam jerking. Her voice sounds small under the sirens. You can hear radios crackle — commands, clipped and urgent.

Footsteps pound through the leaves toward the road. An officer’s shout splits the air: “Freeze! Police — get down!” There is a flash of tactical light and a human shape moving fast; another voice, authoritative and controlled: “Drop the weapon!”

You keep your back to the tree, hands still clenched, chest a hard drum. A beam of blue sweeps across Ms. Chase and then the police are on her — shouting orders, shoving her down, handcuffs biting metal onto her wrists. For a brutal second she snarls at them, then her shoulders slump as officers take the gun away.

An officer’s shadow falls across your hiding place. “You all right?” he calls softly. Your voice cracks when you answer. They pull you out into the open gently, blanketing you with jackets while medics and detectives move in.

“Ms. Chase murdered Kylie and Nyx!” you shout out.

“Lies!” hisses Ms. Chase. “She’s delusional.”

You pull your phone out of your pocket and press play. Ms. Chase’s voice calls out in the darkness “Fine. One final interview. Three questions before I kill you. Consider it professional courtesy.”

Ms. Chase’s face goes pale. “Always get a recording,” you say in weary triumph. “Thanks for the advice.”

Detective Garcia kneels beside you, her face less stern than you remembered — softer now, almost sheepish. “Your friends managed to call us. We got here as fast as we could,” she says. You want to say she wasn’t there sooner; instead you let the sirens and uniforms and lights flood you with relief so intense it’s dizzying.

You survive the night. You survive with bruises and shaking hands and the knowledge that you are lucky — and furious at how close you came. You watch as officers take Ms. Chase away, cuffing the teacher who was a double life. Later, the detectives will catalog evidence: the recorder, witnesses’ statements, the barn and the cellar. Kylie and Nyx’s cases will get new leads because of what you found and what you survived. The road to justice will be long, imperfect, and harder than you imagined — but at least it exists.

You will never be the same. But you will live to try.
