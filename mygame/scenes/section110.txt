You decide to track down some of the kids from your homeroom for the Blah interview. Most of them have the same English class with you, so you find them in the following period. The classroom hums with its usual background noise: the shuffle of papers, the faint squeak of dry-erase markers, someone tapping a pencil against a desk in uneven rhythm. The air smells faintly of old books and reheated cafeteria muffins.

You glance around. If the Blahs exist anywhere, it’s here—the back rows, the kids who slide into class unnoticed and slip out the same way. You tighten your grip on your notebook and walk toward the first desk.

"Hey," you say, forcing a friendly smile. "I’m writing a piece on Cliques. Could I ask you about… you know, being a Blah?"

The girl’s eyes widen. Her lips press together before she gathers her books in silence and walks out the door without a word.

Your stomach drops. Strike one.

You turn to a boy near the window, his hoodie pulled up over his head. "What do you think about the Blah label? Does it fit?"

His head jerks up, eyes narrowing. "I’m not a Blah," he snaps, his voice louder than you expected. A couple of kids glance over. He shoves his chair back and stalks away, leaving the legs screeching against the floor.

Heat creeps up your neck. Strike two.

One more chance. You approach a girl with earbuds dangling around her neck. "I just want to know what it feels like," you say. "No judgment. Promise."

She shakes her head, lips tight, and pushes the earbuds back in. No words. No eye contact.

Strike three.

You clutch your notebook, its pages still stubbornly blank, and retreat to your desk. For all your effort, the Blahs remain exactly what they’ve always been: silent, invisible, and impossible to pin down.

With a sigh, you give up and get ready for class.
