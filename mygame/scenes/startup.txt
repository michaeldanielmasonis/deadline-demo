[b]THE STORY SO FAR[/b]

You are Jessica Lane, a sixteen-year-old high school student in her junior year at Madison High. You live with your mother, Vivian Kravitz, who is a real estate agent in the small but affluent town of Carlton, Virginia. Your father, Henry Lane, is a big-shot editor for the Miami Herald whom you mostly see on weekends and holidays since your parents divorced.

You share your father’s passion for journalism and have taken the high school newspaper, The Puma Post, as an elective class since your freshman year. Your best friends, Abigail Whalley and Charles Knightly, have been with you since middle school. Abbey is the junior class president, and Charlie is a photographer for the Post.

In your journalistic pursuit of the truth, you will have to make many choices. Some will be seemingly mundane or humorous, while others will be quite serious. Some could even lead to your death. Occasionally, the choices you make will have an impact on the kind of person you choose to be. This is measured in points called “cool.” Your points start at zero. Keep track of your cool score in the back of the book, and if you survive to the end to publish your story, see how your character measures up. Additionally, some of the choices you make will affect your relationships with the people around you. This is measured in “trust” points. Trust points are the key to locking or unlocking certain options later in the story. Along the way, you will also have the chance to gather evidence and conduct interviews to complete your story. How many interviews you have successfully completed will ultimately determine how–or if–you have solved the mystery and whether or not you’ve succeeded as a journalist.

Good luck! Remember, check your facts and watch your step… high school can be brutal. Oh yes, and try not to die.
