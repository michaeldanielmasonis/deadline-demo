The barn is too quiet as you sweep your flashlight across cobwebbed corners and piles of forgotten junk. Dust tickles your throat with every breath. After minutes of searching, you’re ready to call it a waste—until your shoe catches on something that isn’t wood.

You stumble, then crouch low. Brushing away brittle hay and rotted straw, your fingers strike cold metal. Your heart lurches. It’s a square, recessed flush with the floorboards. A trapdoor.

You tug at the handle, straining until your shoulders ache. It doesn’t move. You jam your crowbar into the seam and push, but the lid won’t budge. Panic edges into frustration.

You shine your light around desperately—and freeze. Against one of the support beams, a small metal box catches your beam. Two buttons. One red. One green.

You swallow hard and press the green.

The floor shudders under you as hidden hydraulics groan awake. Slowly, the trapdoor yawns open. A rush of air rises up, cold and damp, tinged with the sharp tang of chemicals. The smell makes your eyes water.

A metal ladder descends into the black. You grip the crowbar tighter, wedge the flashlight between your arm and chest, and step down. Each rung vibrates under your shoes, pinging softly like chimes in the silence. Your breath fogs in front of your face.

The cellar swallows you.

Concrete walls loom on all sides, slick with condensation. Your light sweeps across shelves lined with jars, flasks, and tubing—a makeshift chemistry lab. The sharp, acrid odor of solvents clings to the back of your throat. Against one wall, plastic-wrapped bags are stacked like bricks, their labels faded but neat.

Your stomach knots. Drugs.

You press on, the beam of your flashlight bobbing as your hand trembles. At the far end, a narrow door waits. Its latch resists, then clicks open. A blast of cold air washes over you, sharp enough to sting your eyes.

You step inside.

For a second, your mind refuses to process what your light reveals. A figure hangs from the center of the room on a meat hook, utterly still. Blond hair frozen in place, face drained of warmth. Recognition crashes into you like ice: Kylie Addams.

Your knees buckle. You clutch the doorframe, choking back a cry. Alone, the silence is crushing—there’s no one to steady you, no one to say it aloud.

Then your light shifts. On the floor nearby, another body lies motionless, arm outstretched as if reaching for Kylie. Nyx Poulson.

You stagger backward, bile rising in your throat. Despite your grief, you notice there is no blood or wound coming from him.

A sudden realization comes to you. “They must have overdosed him to get the police off their trail.” 

And then a new light floods the chamber. White, blinding. A voice echoes from behind you, calm, mocking, horribly familiar.

“Well,” it says smoothly, “you’re sharper than I gave you credit for. But it’s too bad you’ll never leave here to tell anyone about it.”

The trap door slams shut, and the cellar feels suddenly smaller.
