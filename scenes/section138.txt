You’re back in the dance hall on the side, pretending to stare out the window, when Abbey weaves through the crowd toward you. Her face is pale under the swirling lights, and she clutches her phone like it’s about to burn her fingers.

"Jessi," she hisses, tugging you toward a quieter corner near the bleachers. "I didn’t want to say anything in front of the guys yet, but I found something earlier today. While I was decorating for the dance."

Your heart stutters. "What did you find?"

Abbey glances around before leaning close. "An unlocked phone. It was shoved behind a box in the storage room off the gym. Jessi… it was Kylie’s."

The blood drains from your face. "Kylie’s?"

Abbey nods, her eyes wide. "The battery was nearly dead. I didn’t have time to go through much, but there was one thing — a draft message. She never sent it, but I took a screenshot before the phone shut off."

Abbey flips her phone around. The screenshot glows faintly on the screen:

She’s found me. Get help. At the Gardens.

Your stomach flips, the words searing themselves into your memory. "At the Gardens… oh my God."

Abbey bites her lip. "I don’t know why she didn’t just call the police. Maybe she didn’t have time. Or maybe…" Her voice drops lower. "Maybe she didn’t trust them. You’ve seen how Detective Garcia treats anyone who gets too close. Kylie might have been afraid they’d dismiss her. Or worse — that they’d tip off the wrong person."

You swallow hard, your pulse hammering. "Or she was hiding from someone who could’ve intercepted the call. A text draft would be faster… quieter. Something she thought she could slip out before—"

You stop. The words knot in your throat.

Abbey grips your arm. "Jessi, if Kylie was really here at the Gardens, with D’Anglia, then we’re running out of time."

The dance floor spins with color and laughter just a few feet away, but suddenly the music feels like it’s coming from another world — one where Kylie never vanished.
