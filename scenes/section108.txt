The hallway between classes hums with background noise—lockers slamming, sneakers squeaking, the faint odor of cafeteria pizza drifting down the hall. Your notebook feels heavier than usual in your hand. 

Ms. Chase’s voice still echoes in your head: Leave the Delinquents alone. Stick to the Cliques article.  

Which means you need to talk to… the Blahs. 

Your stomach twists. The Blahs aren’t exactly a “group,” not like the Glitterati or the Jocks. They’re everyone and no one—kids who blend in so perfectly you forget they were even at the table until they leave. Nobody likes being called a Blah, because it means you’re faceless. Forgettable. 

But an article is an article.  

You glance toward Charlie and Abbey by the lockers. They’d talk to you—they trust you—but would it feel like betrayal to label your own friends as Blahs? Or you could pick some random kids from homeroom, though you risk them clamming up or even laughing in your face. Or maybe… maybe you let the Blahs stay invisible a little longer, and focus on another clique for now.

What do you do?
