The air in the auto shop feels too still, too heavy. Declan watches you like a hawk, waiting for your choice.

Drop the article. Prove you care.

Your notebook is clutched so tight against your chest your knuckles ache. Weeks of interviews, hours of recordings—all of it suddenly feels flimsy compared to Kylie’s life, compared to Nyx’s desperate face in your memory.

Slowly, you hold the notebook out. “Okay. No Cliques article. Not if it means I lose my chance to help them.”

Declan doesn’t move at first. Then, with deliberate care, he takes the notebook from your hands. His fingers flip through the pages, eyes scanning your scribbled notes and messy handwriting.

“Delete the recordings,” he says at last, voice low and uncompromising.

Your throat tightens. “Declan, that’s—”

“Do it, Lane. All of it. Otherwise, you’re just another vulture looking for a headline.”

Your stomach twists, but you pull your phone from your pocket. The folder of saved interviews stares back at you: Abbey’s reluctant honesty, Charlie’s quiet observations, the Glitterati’s smug soundbites, Geek Squad jokes caught on tape. You bite your lip, then press delete. The files vanish one by one until the folder is empty. You turn the blank screen toward him.

Only then does Declan nod. “Good. Now you’re not here as a reporter—you’re here because you actually care.”

You steady your breath. “So tell me. Please.”

For the first time, something cracks in his expression—weariness, maybe even grief. He pulls his phone from his jacket pocket, unlocks it, and shows you a screenshot. A dim, grainy photo of the MacReady Barn fills the screen, the sky above it bruised with twilight. Below it, one line of text:
God, help me not be too late.

Your heart stops. “That was from Nyx?”

Declan nods. “He sent it to me the night he disappeared. That was the last thing I ever got from him.” He locks the phone and slips it away. “I wanted to go after him. But you know what would’ve happened if the cops caught me or any of us out there. No one believes a Delinquent isn’t guilty of something. But you—” he points at you, his voice hardening— “a Blah like you? They’ll believe you. You can walk into Garcia’s office right now and they’ll listen. You can get the cops to that barn before it’s too late.”

The weight of his words crashes down on you.

Declan’s voice softens, though his eyes stay sharp. “You’ve got one shot at this, Lane. Don’t waste it. Go to the police. Bring them everything you’ve got. And get there fast.”

Before you can answer, your phone buzzes in your hand. Toby. The license plate trace.

You glance back up, but Declan is already ducking under the Camaro hood again, wrench in hand, shutting the door on anything more.

You walk out of the shop wing with empty hands and a pounding heart. The Cliques article is gone.

But maybe—just maybe—you still have a chance to save Kylie. And Nyx.
