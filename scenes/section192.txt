Quickly you look for something to fight with. You spot an old pickaxe leaning against the wall. Right next to it is a rusted shovel and a rake. Pointing silently to the tools, your friends get the idea and grab the makeshift weapons. It’s time!

You clutch the old pickaxe so tightly the wood bites into your palms. Charlie hefts a battered shovel, his jaw set though his knees tremble. Abbey’s fingers wrap around the handle of a rake, knuckles white. Beside you, Zack tightens his grip on the tire iron he refuses to let go.

You look at one another—four kids armed with tools from a forgotten corner of the barn—and then, with a shared nod, you leap through the trapdoor with a wild cry.

The cellar erupts into chaos.

Ms. Chase whirls, her sequined chaperone’s dress catching the harsh flashlight beam. The pistol in her hand barks; Charlie screams as the bullet grazes his arm, blood spraying and the shovel clattering before he snatches it up again with his good hand. It was only a scratch.

The enforcer lunges forward, but Zack surprises him, swinging the tire iron with a yell. The blow crashes against the man’s skull with a dull, ringing thud. He staggers, dazed, though not down.

“Now!” you shout, charging. You swing the pickaxe, its weight dragging through the air, and slam it into Ms. Chase’s shoulder. She shrieks, dropping the gun, which skitters across the concrete.

Abbey rushes past, knees buckling with fear, but determination bright in her eyes. She drops the rake and fumbles at the knots binding Kylie and Nyx. “Hold still!” she whispers fiercely, tugging at the ropes.

Meanwhile, Ms. Chase and you dive for the gun. Her nails scrape your wrist; your breath comes ragged as you slam elbows, knees, anything you can. The weapon spins between you, metal cold and slick with sweat.

“Jessica!” Zack chokes out. The enforcer has recovered and wrapped arms like steel cables around his neck. His face purples as he thrashes.

Charlie, bleeding, raises the shovel and brings it down on the enforcer’s back. The hit is weak, but enough. Zack slips free, gasping.

The gun goes off as you fight for control with Ms. Chase. A thunderclap in the cellar.

The enforcer jerks, shock on his face as he staggers backward. He collapses against the wall, groaning, clutching his side. Blood gushes from between his fingers.

The weapon wrenches from your grasp. Ms. Chase stands above you now, the barrel leveled at your chest. “It’s over, Jessica,” she spits. “You should’ve stayed in your lane.”

You close your eyes—

But then she’s wrenched backward with a roar. Nyx, hands still raw from his bindings, has hurled himself at her. He twists her wrist, slamming her to the ground, and the gun spins away again.

He picks it up, his arms shaking, the weapon pointed squarely at Ms. Chase. His voice is hoarse, savage: “You ruined everything. You ruined me. I should—” He pulls back the slide with a loud click. “I should end this.”

Sirens wail above, red and blue lights strobing through the cracks in the floorboards.

“No!” you cry, stumbling forward. “Nyx, don’t. If you do this, you’ll lose everything. She doesn’t get to take your future too.”

Kylie also manages to croak, her throat raw and bruised from where the enforcer had strangled her, “Don’t do it, Nyx. It’s over.”

He hesitates, torn between rage and grief. Ms. Chase sneers, blood streaking her dress. “Foolish boy. You’ll all go to jail for this. No one will believe a bunch of teenagers—or a drug pusher—over a respected teacher.”

Your phone is already in your hand. You press play.

From the tiny speaker, her own voice pours into the room, crisp and unmistakable: “You’ll watch what happens to her. Then we’ll make yours look accidental.”

The room freezes. Ms. Chase’s face drains of color.

You meet her eyes, fire rising in your chest despite the terror. “Always get a recording,” you tell her. “Thanks for the advice, Ms. Chase.”

The cellar door above bursts open. Armed officers thunder down the ladder. “Police! Weapons down!”

Nyx’s shoulders shake as he lowers the gun. An officer rushes forward to seize Ms. Chase. Two more lift the groaning enforcer onto a stretcher, shackling him as paramedics wheel him out.

Detective Garcia is the last down the ladder. Her eyes sweep the carnage—the blood, the ropes, the kids clutching each other in shock. She shakes her head. “I told you to stay out of this.” Her voice softens, just barely. “But… you were quick, and you were brave. You saved lives tonight.”

Kylie sobs into Abbey’s shoulder. Charlie leans against Zack, wincing at his bandaged arm. Nyx stands apart, trembling, tears on his face.

You close your eyes, the sound of sirens still ringing in your ears. For the first time in days, there is a chance—a chance for the truth to finally come out.
