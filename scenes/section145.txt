“Let’s try one of the windows,” you whisper, eyeing the heavy padlock on the barn doors. “Breaking that thing will sound like a cannon going off.”

Charlie nods quickly. “Yeah, and I’d rather not get caught before we even get inside. Window it is.”

The two of you creep around the side of the barn, the grass damp against your shoes. The boards over the back window are warped with age but nailed in tight. The wood looks almost petrified in the flashlight’s beam, gray and splintered.

“Here goes nothing,” Charlie mutters. He wedges his crowbar into the seam, and with a grunt, the board shrieks as the nails bend. The sound is sharp enough to make your teeth clench. You both freeze, holding your breath.

Silence. Just the steady drone of crickets and the rustle of a breeze through the trees.

Charlie exhales shakily. “One down.”

Together, you pry the rest of the boards free. Each one gives way reluctantly, groaning before it finally pops loose. You lower them carefully into the grass, praying they don’t clatter.

Behind you, the window gapes like a dark mouth. Most of the glass is already shattered, only a few jagged edges clinging to the frame. The air that drifts through smells of dust, mildew, and old hay.

Charlie crouches, cupping his hands together. “Okay, ninja,” he whispers with a crooked smile. “Foot here. I’ll give you a boost.”

You roll your eyes but step into his grip. His hands are warm and steady as he pushes you upward. Your fingers scrape against the rough sill as you haul yourself higher, hoodie snagging briefly on a nail.

“Almost there,” Charlie whispers, bracing you.

You wriggle past the last shard of glass and tumble inside, landing on the dusty floor with a muffled thud. The air explodes with motes of dust, choking and dry. You cough into your sleeve, flashlight beam darting wildly across the cavernous dark.

From outside, Charlie’s voice hisses, “You okay?”

“Yeah,” you whisper back, brushing hay off your knees. “Your turn.”

“Lucky me,” he mutters, before starting to climb.
