You slam Declan’s words down on the table like they’re burning through your hands. “We can’t just hand this off. If we wait for the police to get warrants, it’ll be too late.”

Zack frowns, glancing between you, Charlie, and Abbey. “So what’s the plan, Jess?”

“We go ourselves,” you say firmly. “We call Garcia on the way, give her everything, but we don’t sit around and hope. Kylie and Nyx need us now.”

Abbey bites her lip. “That’s… dangerous.”

Charlie adjusts his glasses, determination flickering in his eyes. “It’s always been dangerous. But she’s right. If we don’t go, we’ll regret it forever.”

Minutes later, the four of you are piled into Zack’s beat-up pickup, the tires spitting gravel as you roar out of the school parking lot. The late afternoon sun is sliding toward the horizon, staining the sky orange and purple. It feels like the whole world is holding its breath.

Abbey grips her phone, knuckles white. “I’ll call Garcia,” she says, and dials with shaking fingers.

You listen as the line clicks, then Detective Garcia’s voice answers, clipped and suspicious. “Garcia.”

“It’s Abbey Whalley,” she blurts out, “and we’re with Jessica Lane—”

“Wait. Jessica Lane?” Garcia’s tone sharpens. “What are you kids up to now?”

“We found evidence,” Abbey insists, her voice trembling but clear. “The MacReady Barn. Nyx texted about it before he disappeared. There’s drugs, and Kylie’s in danger. Please—send officers. Now.”

There’s a long pause. You can almost feel Garcia trying to decide if she believes you this time.

“We’re on our way,” she finally says. “Stay put until we arrive.”

You meet your friends’ eyes. Nobody says it out loud, but you all know what you’re thinking: Too late isn’t an option.

The truck rumbles down the highway. Every bump feels like it rattles through your bones. Charlie clutches the duffel bag of tools Abbey packed, while you stare out the window, your heart pounding louder than the radio static in the background.

“You sure about this?” Zack asks quietly.

“No,” you admit. “But Kylie doesn’t have anyone else.”

Ahead, in the fading light, the silhouette of the old MacReady Barn rises against the sky, black and looming, like a shadow waiting to swallow you whole.

You clench your fists. This is it.

Kylie and Nyx’s lives depend on what happens next.
