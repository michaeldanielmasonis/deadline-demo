You shut your notebook with a soft thwap, the blank page staring up at you like an accusation. You couldn’t be sure you were safe to ask your friends about being a Blah. And in your mind, the blurry, almost invisible faces of those in your homeroom who could also be a Blah stare at you in offense. Failure on both accounts.

But maybe you’re going about this wrong.

The truth is, nobody wants to admit they’re a Blah. The label stings—invisible, forgettable, a filler character in everyone else’s story. You know that sting all too well. If you’re being honest, you’re a Blah yourself.

And so was Kylie.

You picture her slipping through the hallways, not part of the Glitterati, not exactly Geek Squad, not strange enough to be a Death Eater, but everywhere at once—talking to people, organizing things, laughing in quiet corners. She was the most active Blah you’d ever seen. Not wallpaper. Not background. Something else.

Maybe that’s the angle. If you could talk to Kylie, maybe she could tell you what being a Blah really meant—not an insult, not a dismissal, but an identity. A survival strategy.

The thought twists in your chest. Finding Kylie isn’t just about breaking the story anymore. It’s about understanding yourself, too.

But first, you’d have to find her.
